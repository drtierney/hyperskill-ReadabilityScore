# hyperskill-ReadabilityScore
Developing a program that can identify the difficulty of a piece of text and identify the suitable reading age. https://hyperskill.org/projects/39

**Stage 1 Simple estimatation**
Input a phrase or a sentence for the program to determine its difficulty level based on the symbol count.

**Stage 2 Words and sentences**
Apply your knowledge of advanced strings, arrays and regular expressions: determine how difficult the text is judging by the average count of words in the sentences.

**Stage 3 Score!**
Add a readability score based on a special formula: it will estimate the difficulty levels of larger bodies of texts uploaded from a file.

**Stage 4 More parameters**
More parameters can be taken into account: for example, you can consider syllables and letters. Enable the program to base its estimation on those parameters altogether.
